# Personal Website Template
This project is for generating sites similar to my own website cihanbosnali.com. The UI is influenced by streaming websites such as Disney+. My motivation was to update the content easily without changing the code. Hence, all content is written to json files. You can use json files to add cards and other information. You can add images to the public data folder and mention them in your json to use them on your cards.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
