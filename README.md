# Personal Website Template
This project is for generating sites similar to my own website cihanbosnali.com. The UI is influenced by video streaming websites. My motivation was to update the content easily without changing the code. Hence, all content is written to json files. You can use json files to add cards and other information. You can add images to the public data folder and mention them in your json to use them on your cards.

## Adding Data
The [data_example](https://github.com/CihanBosnali/personal-website-22-template/tree/main/src/data_example) folder includes json files necessary to generate your website. You can change this files and rename the folder to "data" in order to add your data to your website build.
